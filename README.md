# Deconstructing Penn Pathways
Deconstructing Penn Pathways is an interactive data project conducted by The Signal, in partnership with Career Services,
that links what students did each summer to their pursuits post-grad. Our purpose is to alleviate confusion around choosing
a “perfect internship” and expose students to a diverse set of possible journeys to take here at Penn.
The sample includes 2231 students in the Class of 2017 surveyed by Career Services, with 553 from the Wharton School,
340 from the Engineering School, 129 from the Nursing School, and 1317 from the College of Arts and Sciences.
